      <description>Text mining FOMC Minutes 2021-01-27Sentiment has clearly picked up during the fall. One interesting point is that there is a positive net sentiment index, but still below average intensifier index which indicates that the negative words are more connected with intensifier words then what positive words are.Mapping Feds mind gives further juice on this as topics/words like strong, expansion are up and coming while decline, weak are well below its short and long term average.</description>

With the field of text mining, this projects breaks down the Minutes into multiple areas making plots out of words.
