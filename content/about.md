Hi and welcome to my page. IÂ´m Christoffer and living in Stockholm.

This page will mostly cover economic topics from a data driven perspective. As my profile includes seasoned experience from the Fixed Income market, Central banking and Treaury - this page will have an emhasis on these parts.

As I have a big interest in coding and developing my skills in these areas, my ambition is to transform numbers to insights with the use of various tools from the data scientist toolbox. 

Please feel free to reach out. [Mail easiest.](mailto:christoffer.nordenlow@outlook.com?) 

*This is a personal site. Everything written here will be my own personal thoughts, and have nothing to do with my current or former employer.*

Thanks for reading!
