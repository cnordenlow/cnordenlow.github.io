Hi and welcome.

This page will mostly cover economic topics from a data driven perspective. As I have a big interest in coding and developing my skills in these areas, my ambition is to transform economic numbers to insights with the use of various tools from the data scientist toolbox. 

As my profile includes seasoned experience from the Fixed Income market, Central banking and Treaury - this page will have an emphasis on these parts.

Please feel free to reach out by [mail](mailto:christoffer.nordenlow@outlook.com?). 

*This is a personal site. Everything written here will be my own personal thoughts, and have nothing to do with my current or former employer.*
