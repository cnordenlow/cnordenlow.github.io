Hi and welcome to my page. I´m Christoffer and living in Stockholm.

During the days, I´m working as a Portfolio Manager for Fixed Income Assets in the Central bank world (which world is not central bank world right now?!).
 
Maybe not surprisingly after that introduction (...and being an Economics student alumni), the fields of economy is a big interest of mine - especially with a focus on the nitty gritty parts of it. What´s driving what, and how can you plot this? Or why is ISM Manufacturing picking up faster then Markit? Can it be with how they are asking the questions?

This page will mostly circle around approaches to understand bigger and smaller parts of the market and economy, but it can also involve other areas like sports which is a big interest. I´m trying to explore these areas within the fields of data science, something I would really like to master. Code sharing is an important part of that - being able to share what you write will put pressure on how you do it. I have long ways to go there. 

Please feel free to reach out. [Mail easiest.](mailto:christoffer.nordenlow@outlook.com?)

Thanks for reading!
